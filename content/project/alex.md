Alexander Beyer was born and raised in Erlangen, Germany. He holds a bachelor degree from Eberhard-Karls-University in TÃ¼bingen, and attended Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, NY as an exchange student. Currently he is a PhD-student at Simon-Fraser-University in Vancouver. His research focuses on the communications strategies of right-wing parties in Germany, Italy, and Austria. A second aspect he is interested in is the role of elite-messaging for individual reactions towards the far-right. What effects do strategic responses of mainstream parties to these extremists have? For his work he utilizes multi-level modeling, automated data collection, as well as network analysis, machine learning, and text-as-data approaches.
In his free time he enjoys riding motorcycles and tinkering to keep his 1993 Ford Explorer on the road. When he doesn't feel the need to get grease on his hands he can be found throwing disc-golf discs, and playing fingerstyle-tunes on his guitar.
