Alexander Beyer was born and raised in Erlangen, Germany. He holds a bachelor degree from Eberhard-Karls-University in Tübingen, and attended Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, NY as an exchange student. Currently he is a PhD-student at Simon-Fraser-University in Vancouver. His research focuses on the communications strategies of right-wing parties in Germany, Italy, and Austria. A second aspect he is interested in is the role of elite-messaging for individual reactions towards the far-right. What effects do strategic responses of mainstream parties to these extremists have? For his work he utilizes multi-level modeling, automated data collection, as well as network analysis, machine learning, and text-as-data approaches.
In his free time he enjoys riding motorcycles and tinkering to keep his 1993 Ford Explorer on the road. When he doesn't feel the need to get grease on his hands he can be found throwing disc-golf discs, and playing fingerstyle-tunes on his guitar.

With Steve Weldon (2018). “Pointing Fingers at the Media? Coverage of the 2017 Bundestag Election.” German Politics and Society 36 (1), pp. 105-124. DOI: doi.org/10.3167/gps.2018.360106

Abstract:
The German election in September 2017 brought a tectonic shift to the layout of German politics. With the AfD in parliament far-right illiberalism has reached the mainstream. We investigate the communicative developments underlying this rise. Using web-scraping and automated content analysis, we collected over 10.000 articles from mainstream-news and far-right blogs, along with over 90GBs of Tweets during the leadup to election day. This allows us a deep insight into how public discourse works in 2017 Germany.


Work-in-Progress:
"Frankenstein's Consultazioni - The social media effects of forging an unlikely coalition between Lega and 5*Stelle"
Abstract:
The formation of a coalition between the right-wing Lega and the 'ideologically flexible' 5*Stelle Movement was an unlikely outcome of Italy's 2018 election. To study the effects that elites play to influence the discourse of their followers I collected 150GBs of tweets from Italy shortly before the election and during the coalition talks. With these data I want to model the influence that the actions of the political elites of both parties had on the bulk of their followers over time. How did the twitter-spheres of Lega and 5*Stelle react to the talks between the leadership? Did the talks increase overlap or not affect the followers at all?
