# Welcome

Welcome to the Political Extremism and Democracy Research Group (PED Research) in the Political Science Department at Simon Fraser University, directed by Dr. Steven Weldon. Our group conducts its research from the Burnaby campus, situated on the top of Burnaby Mountain. The main focus of our research is the effects that political extremism has on all matter relating to democracy, but projects by group memebrs cover a range of other related topics in political science.
